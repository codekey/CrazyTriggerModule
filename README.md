# CrazyTriggerModule

Here is a project that I was designing for a company when I was doing contract work. the CTM-10 is a spin off of a product I designed many years ago called the TR-7. The only difference is that the CTM-10 is limited in features due to the rotary switch selection as opposed to the TR-7 was programmable so had 16 features + 7 additional features.

Description:
The CTM-10 is a universal trigger module with multiple features built into one module. The CTM-10 has 3 trigger inputs that
can take a constant or pulsed input. The CTM-10 has 3 outputs that are either Constant, Timed, Pulsed, Latching or toggle
outputs. The features are selectable using a rotary switch.
