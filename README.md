# TriggerModule
Crazy Trigger module

Here is a project that I was designing for contract work.

The CTM-10 is a universal trigger module with multiple features built into one module. The CTM-10 has 3 trigger inputs that
can take a constant or pulsed input. The CTM-10 has 3 outputs that are either Constant, Timed, Pulsed, Latching or toggle
outputs. The features are selectable using a rotary switch.
